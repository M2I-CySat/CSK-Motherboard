Design Review Notes

Power-on (ramp-up). Compare EPS specifications to brown-out limitations of STM32

Effect of loss of 3v3 rail on pull-up resistors
Split between power rails for pull-ups. Allow system critical pull-ups to work in case of 3v3 failure.
LDO diodes, or just a way to do it (supervisor chip) - one 3v3 rail with two sources.
Memory on 3v3 rail, failure of 3v3
Buffers belonging to which rail - PMIC (power management IC)

Decoupling at the end of the enable line for buffers
Decoupling for I2C buffers

Check EN logic on I2C buffers (active low?)
Check logic levels on all the buffers anyway

Pullup on unused pins (in software)

Unused buffer needs to be tied to something

74LS125 unpopulated tie-off resistors

Snubbing network for off-board SPI (series resistor)

Logic to make sure reset can't happen unless it's supposed to

GPIO behavior while MCU is in reset
